PyCity Schools is an analysis of district-wide standardized test results. 
The analysis compares student performance vs the school they attended. Data 
compared includes size and type of school and how much schools spend per 
student, among other data elements. 

A hight level analysis is captured at the top of the PyCity Schools file. 

Included alongside the PyCity Schools file is a Resource folder containing 
the original csv files.
